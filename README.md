# Sorry, Dave

#### Application to convert users input into different returns based on what numbers they include or if the value of their input is evenly divisible by 3  17 Aug 2018

#### By Krystal Foster

## Description

Launched on [GitHub Pages](https://eucile.github.io/sorrydave) Using for loops and basic branching logic, this website furthers my exploration into javascript by taking user integers and converting user input that includes specific numbers, like 1 or 0, into different outputs.

## Behavior-driven Development Steps:

| **Program replaces any input including a 0 with "Beep!"** | User input: "0" | Output: "Beep!" |
| **Program replaces any input including a 1 with "Boop!"**| User Input: "13" | Output: "Boop!" |
| **Program replaces numbers evenly divisible by 3 with "I'm sorry, Dave, I can't do that."**| Input: "87" | Output: "I'm sorry Dave..." |
| **Program overrides previous specs if more "important" specs are met. In this application, that is (in order of most to least important): numbers divisible by 3, numbers including 1, and numbers including 0.** | Input: "30" Output: "I'm sorry, Dave..." |
