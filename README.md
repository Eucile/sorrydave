# Sorry, Dave

#### Application to convert user input into different returns based on what numbers they include or if the value of their input is evenly divisible by 3  17 Aug 2018

#### By Krystal Foster

## Description

This project is launched on [GitHub Pages](https://eucile.github.io/sorrydave)

 Using for loops and some branching logic, this application furthers my exploration into javaScript by taking user integers and converting input that includes specific numbers, like 1 or 0, into different outputs.

## Behavior-driven Development Steps:

| **Program replaces 0's with "Beep"** | User input: "0" | Output: "Beep!" |
| **Program replaces any 1's with "Boop!"**| User Input: "1" | Output: "Boop!" |
| **Program replaces numbers evenly divisible by 3 with "I'm sorry, Dave, I can't do that."**| User input: "30" | Output: "I'm sorry Dave..." |
| **Program overrides previous specs if the whole inputted number is divisible by 3. In this application, that would mean 1's and 0's are replaced in a range, but if the number itself happens to be divisible by 3, only the message would appear.** | User input: "30" Output: "I'm sorry, Dave..." |
||**Program returns the reversed range of numbers not divisible by 3, replacing 1's and 0's** || User input: "4" | Output: "32Boop!Beep!" |
||**Program checks that the input is a number and alerts the user if it is not.** | User input: "hi" | Output: "Please enter a number, Dave." |
